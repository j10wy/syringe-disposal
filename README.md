# syringe-disposal
An app where SF residents enter in the location of syringes on the street that need to get cleaned up - or request that an area gets special attention before an event in a park or other SF location--- or a neighborhood group could request regular cleanups block by block near their homes. It would be like a dispatcher app- pretty simple---the app would map the location of the syringes and send a text out to volunteers who were logged on to help with cleanup- an on-duty volunteer would claim the task (like a bike messenger picking up a tag) and it would be assigned to them, and then when they were done picking up the reported syringes the volunteer would text the app back with the details- the app would track the syringes cleaned up/# of pick ups done and the volunteer who did the pickup/map the pickups.
